MyFAIR Analysis is a web application designed to allow scientists to create FAIR data, and to provide FAIR data analysis such that the “end to end” analysis complies with FAIR data principles. MyFAIR analysis is a python application and graphical user interface (GUI) that uses Galaxy2 for analytical workflows and B2DROP3(EUDAT) for FAIR data storage.  Our proof of concept to test myFAIR analysis uses the genome in a bottle trio-samples available form  galaxy training for genetic variation analysis.
