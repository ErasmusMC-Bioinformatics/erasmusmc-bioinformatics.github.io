Though of tremendous benefit to global health, antibiotics currently represent the most misused drugs in the world. Global overuse is estimated at 40%-70%, with overuse leading to preventable adverse events that may impact on patient care. Importantly, overuse also leads to the emergence of antibiotic-resistance, a phenomenon that is recognized as a major threat to global health. Further, the current diagnostic tools for facilitating the appropriate use of antibiotics are often inadequate as antibiotic consumption and the spread of antibiotic resistance are continually increasing.


The TAILORED-Treatment project aims to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the need for, and type of, antimicrobial therapy required for individual patients"
